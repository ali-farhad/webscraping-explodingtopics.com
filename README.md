# webscraping-explodingtopics.com

This repo holds web scraping project   that I did on https://www.explodingtopics.com

The following technologies were used in this project:

 1. Nodejs
 2. Cheerio
 3. Google Spreadsheets
 
 **Purpose:**
 we are webscraping all the trending words for the word, and then storing them in google spreadsheet programmatically. you can check this sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IFm6KIGi6Pt96uMB3L7lrRjq-cRzzxg-q8RRGMIg8aI/edit#gid=0)

However, you may get the most updated results, by running this project locally again.
